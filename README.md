# Ehon Visual Similiarity Database

This is a database, built on the [Mongaku image similarity database software](https://github.com/mongaku/mongaku), that provides image similarity analysis of [Ehon (Japanese picture books)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-hon).

A hosted version of the database is hosted at Ritsumeikan University in Kyoto: https://ehon.dh-jac.net/

This project was built with a grant from [Ritsumeikan University: Digitial Humanities Center for Japanese Arts and Cultures](http://dh-jac.net/).
